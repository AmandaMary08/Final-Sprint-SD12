Project 3 : JavaScript Final Sprint (Individual project)

Author: Amanda Guzzwell
Dates: July 31 - Aug 12, 2024

I have all of my files completed to the best of my ability. For some reason my Live Server would not open with my files. I have researched many ways to manually do 
this without any luck. I have scoured my code to see if something is missing or not linked correctly and I have come up with no answer. And so, I have not been able to 
see if my style sheet or data is presented correctly. I promise is was not for lack of effort :(
